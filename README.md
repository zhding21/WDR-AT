This directory contains code to reproduce the results in our paper:

"Weight Decay Regularized Adversarial Training for Attacking Angle Imbalance" by Guorong Wang, Jinchuan Tang, Zehua Ding, Shuping Dang, Gaojie Chen.

#### Training datasets
Four datasets are used in our paper, including: MNIST (https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), CIFAR-10\100 (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), and Tiny-ImageNet (https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet/data).

#### Adversarial Training
To train an adversarial training model called FGSM contrast method, you can execute:
```
python3 FGSM-main.py
```
To train an adversarial training model of our FGSM method, you can execute:
```
python3 FGSM-main-WDR.py
```
To train an adversarial training model called FAT contrast method, you can execute:
```
python3 FAT-main.py
```
To train an adversarial training model of our FAT method, you can execute:
```
python3 FAT-main-WDR.py
```
To train an adversarial training model called PGD contrast method, you can execute:
```
python3 PGD-main.py
```
To train an adversarial training model of our PGD method, you can execute:
```
python3 PGD-main-WDR.py
```

To train an adversarial training model for the comparison method named PGI (code reference: https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/FGSM-PGI), you can execute:
```
python3 PGI-main.py
```

To train an adversarial training model for our PGI method, you can execute:
```
python3 PGI-main-WDR.py
```

To train an adversarial training model for the comparison method named MEP (code reference: [https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/FGSM-PGI](https://github.com/Mengnan-Zhao-Happy/ConvergeSmooth)), you can execute:
```
python3 MEP-main.py
```

To train an adversarial training model for our MEP method, you can execute:
```
python3 MEP-main-WDR.py
```

#### Adversarial Attack Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of each adversarial model, you can execute:
```
python3 Evaluation.py
```
